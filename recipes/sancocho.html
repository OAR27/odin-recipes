        <h1>True Dominican Sancocho</h1>

        <img src="../images/Sancocho.png" alt="7 meat stew called a sancocho">

            <p>My fiance is from the D.R. and his mother has made me some amazing food! The first time she made sancocho I fell in love with it. It is often made with 7 different meats for a special festivity or holiday.</p>

            <p> I have simplified the meats in my version, but don't be afraid to use many kinds; this is my mimicked recipe. Great by itself or served the traditional way over rice. Super filling and even better the next day.</p>

                <li>1 ½ pounds Spanish pumpkin, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>1 pound eddeos, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>½ pound yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>½ pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>2 green plantains, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                <li>2 ears corn on the cob, cut into quarters</li>
                <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
                <li>2 large carrots, chopped, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 large green bell pepper, diced</li>
                <li>1 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>1 dash adobo seasoning (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Mash garlic, oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Douse chicken, beef, and pork with lemon juice in a large bowl. Drain half the liquid. Mix the mashed garlic, half of the onions, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vinegar into the meat mixture.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat mixture in batches and cook until browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the browned meats into a large pot. Add half of the water, chicken broth, beef consomme, 2 bouillon cubes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meats are more than halfway cooked through, about 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn, celery, carrots, green pepper, cilantro, and adobo seasoning in the simmering pot. Return soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until the sancocho is thick and the root vegetables are soft, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in the remaining half of the water by gradual increments to replace any evaporated liquid.</li>
